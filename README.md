# JavaScript Callbacks

This repository contains examples and explanations related to the usage of callbacks in JavaScript.

## What are Callbacks?

In JavaScript, a callback is a function passed as an argument to another function to be executed later, often after an asynchronous operation completes or some other condition is met. Callbacks are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, especially in asynchronous programming.

## Why Use Callbacks?

Callbacks are commonly used to handle asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or performing other non-blocking operations. They allow you to specify what should happen after an operation completes without blocking the execution of other code.
